# How-Tall-Are-You
Python program that converts your height into fun measures

# Description
This is a Python project that allows users to convert their height to measures of various objects. I made this as a way to get my feet wet with Tkinter and GUI programming in Python. Not very aesthetically pleasing but whatever. The chosen objects are pretty arbitrary, but it would be easy to add more by editing the object_heights dictionary.
